+Code the following app
+```
+I want to create a simple 2-player “Chicken Race” game. Please generate the full code and instructions. Here are the requirements:
+
+The game has two players.
+
+Each player has their own key/button to press rapidly.
+
+The player who presses their button faster wins.
+
+The game should:
+
+Start when I press a “Start” button or when the program runs.
+
+Count how many times each player presses their button.
+
+Stop after a set time (example: 5 seconds) or when someone reaches a certain number of presses.
+
+Show who won and the press count of both players.
+
+Make the game visual with a simple UI (web/JS OR Python tkinter — you choose).
+
+Add instructions on how players should press the buttons:
+
+Player 1 key: (example: A)
+
+Player 2 key: (example: L)
+
+Make sure the game updates live on the screen (press count increasing).
+
+After the game ends, show a “Play Again” option.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
